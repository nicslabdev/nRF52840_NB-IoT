# nRF52840_NB-IoT

This application stablish a bypass connection between USB UART and Arduino serial pins UART, i.e. D0 and D1 pins.

This is used in order to manage NB-IoT module directly through AT commands.

This code has been developed for Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840 DK and NB-IoT Arduino shield. 

Tested NB-IoT shileds: AVNET BG96 and Sodaq Sara N211.
